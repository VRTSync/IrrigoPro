/**
 * Step reporting contract (Task #1982)
 * ------------------------------------
 * A step result is a claim about the database, so it must only be made about
 * writes the database has already accepted:
 *
 *  1. Report `success` **after** the writes it vouches for are committed.
 *     Inside a `db.transaction(...)` callback nothing is committed yet, so a
 *     `success` result (or a `success` emit) built there can still be undone
 *     by a rollback. Collect what happened inside the callback, return it, and
 *     push the result after `db.transaction()` resolves.
 *  2. `rowsAffected` counts rows that are actually present afterwards — the
 *     committed row count, not the number of statements attempted.
 *  3. When a migration writes a completion marker, that marker is written in
 *     the **same transaction** as the writes it vouches for. A marker in its
 *     own autocommit statement can outlive rolled-back writes and turn the
 *     migration's own `check()` into a lie.
 *
 * Migrations that do all their work in autocommit satisfy (1) trivially: each
 * statement is committed as it returns.
