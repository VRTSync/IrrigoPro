// Task #1864 — Unit tests for computeCustomerSpend.
//
// These tests exercise the canonical spend function that replaces three
// diverging hand-rolled loops in budget-routes, budget-alert-service, and
// financial-pulse customer summary. The function has two I/O seams:
//
//   1. storage.getInvoicesByCustomerIds — patched in-memory (no Postgres)
//   2. db.select                        — proxied via a tiny chainable shim
//
// Task #2017 — computeCustomerSpend is now a wrapper over
// computeCustomerSpendBatch, which moved both seams: the invoice leg reads
// the batch storage method, and the wet-check leg joins customers for tenancy.
// The db shim is therefore TABLE-AWARE: it answers the wet-check query with
// wet-check rows and refuses any other table, so an invoice row can never be
// silently re-counted as a wet-check billing (the old single-row-set shim
// would have answered both queries with the same rows).
