/**

 * Invariant: invoice-construction filter sites use `wcbIsEligible(wcb)` which
 * gates on `unroutedFindingsCount === 0` (every finding on the parent wet check
 * triaged or auto-billed) rather than the old blunt `wetCheckStatus === 'converted'`
 * check which blocked partially_converted wet checks even when all findings were
 * actually routed.
 *
 * Visibility paths must NOT gate on wetCheckStatus so that partially-converted-
 * parent WCBs are still reachable by billing managers.
